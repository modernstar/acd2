don't start RTP stream on outgoing call
make FSM for call
better log management


future:
    use epoll with resiprocate
    make attended xfer
        Q INVITE dest with hold audio
        on OK, Q sends REFER to caller
        expect 202 otherwise kill destination call.
            set call as Transfering (do not allow a transfer again)
        on Notify 200 OK, set as state Transfered.
